I am fascinated by the potential of data science for real estate investing. Quantitative investing has already taken over the hedge fund world and I believe that, as more and more data becomes available, the biggest asset class in the world is ready to take advantage of these same techniques. Sound judgement and expert financial modelling will always remain important (for that you can check [my other repo](https://github.com/mdcnuydt/financial-modelling)) but it will be supplemented by more data driven assumptions.

This repo contains some datasets I've played around. This is solely intended for personal use but feel free to download them if they can be of any use to you. If you are passionate about real estate and data science as well, feel free to contact me. I would love to talk! 

Currently there are two notebooks online. More will follow once I've cleaned them up a bit. Datasets can be found in the datasets folder.

**Current notebooks**
- *avm_singapore.ipynb*: This notebook builds an automated valuation model for properties in Singapore.
- *ts_south_africa.ipynb*: This notebook makes forecasts based on time-series data from South African houses.
