This repo contains my data science for real estate analysis projects. Each one is saved in a Jupyter notebook format, which can be consulted in the GitHub viewer or downloaded for own use.

My first project is an Automated Valuation Tool for residential properties in Singapore:
- avm.singapore.ipynb

I am also working on several other projects (cfr. in_progress):
- An automated valuation tool for London
- A location scoring tool for London
- A portfolio valuation tool for Belgiun

Datasets can be found in the datasets folder. Temporarily created files can be found in the temp_files folder.
