I am a big believer in the potential of modern data science techniques to improve real estate investment analysis. Quantitative analysis is already being used by the biggest hedge funds and investment banks and I believe that, as more and more data becomes available, the biggest asset class in the world is ready to benefit from these same techniques. 

Sound judgement and expert financial modelling will always remain important (for that you can check [my other repo](https://github.com/mdcnuydt/financial-modelling)). However, more data driven assumptions are crucial to enhance the analysis.

This repo contains some datasets I've played around and are solely intended for personal use. Currently there are two notebooks online. More will follow once I've cleaned up the code a bit. Datasets can be found in the datasets folder.

**Current notebooks**
- *avm_singapore.ipynb*: This notebook compares ML techniques for building an automated valuation model for real estate in Singapore.
- *ts_south_africa.ipynb*: This notebook makes forecasts based on time-series data from the South African housing market.
